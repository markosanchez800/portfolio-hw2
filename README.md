## Deployed Site
[Site](https://markosanchez800.github.io/portfolio-hw2/)

## Technology Used
- HTML - used to create the logical structure and flow of the page
- CSS - used to give the HTML elements a style and specific positioning on page
- Github - used as repository for the site
- GitBash - used to commit and push code changes to Github and track edits

## Summary
This is my portfolio page that I'll be making use of as I expand my knowledge and work on more advanced projects.  I made use of most HTML and CSS concepts I've learned so far such as flex properties and margins for positioning, pseudoclasses for responsive actions, and gradients/background properties for aesthetic stylings.
